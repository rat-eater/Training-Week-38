Solving explained:

Task A
Directly assigned the given values to the corresponding variables.

Task B
Used multiplication to calculate the desired values based on the variables from Task A.

Task C
Used a for loop with an initial value of 1, a condition to continue as long as the value is less than or equal to 10, and an increment of 1 in each iteration. Printed the current value of the loop variable in each iteration.

Task D
Just like Task C, but used a descending loop by starting with an initial value of 10 and decrementing by 1 in each iteration.

Task E
Used a for loop that starts at 2 (the first even number) and increments by 2 in each iteration. This ensures only even numbers are printed.

Task F
Used a while loop with an initial value of 0. The loop continues as long as the value is less than or equal to 100. The value is printed in each iteration, and then incremented by 1.

Task G
Analyzed the provided code and identified the missing values in the dictionary. Based on the expected output, filled in the missing values with the correct strings.
